# ü©∫ Skin Cancer Detection using EfficientNet-B3

This project focuses on **automated skin cancer classification** using **deep learning**, specifically the **EfficientNet-B3** architecture.  
The model is trained and fine-tuned on the **HAM10000** dataset to classify **seven types of skin lesions**.  
Our approach achieves a validation accuracy of **92.52%**, demonstrating strong potential for assisting dermatologists in early diagnosis of skin cancer.

## üìñ Overview

Skin cancer is one of the most common and deadly forms of cancer worldwide. Early detection significantly increases survival rates, but manual diagnosis is often time-consuming and subjective.  
This project uses **transfer learning, Fine tuning** and **deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** to build an efficient, accurate, and scalable skin cancer detection model.

## üéØ Objectives

- To develop a deep learning model for **multi-class classification** of dermoscopic images.
- Pre processing of Uneven dataset of **HAM10000 dataset**. 
- To fine-tune a **pre-trained EfficientNet-B3** model for the **HAM10000 dataset**.  
- To evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
